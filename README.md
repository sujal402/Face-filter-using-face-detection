## About

This project is a facial keypoint detection system built using TensorFlow and OpenCV. It aims to accurately locate and identify key facial landmarks such as eyes, nose, and mouth.

Using a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, the model is trained on a labeled dataset of facial images to predict the coordinates of these keypoints, enabling various applications in facial analysis and augmentation.
