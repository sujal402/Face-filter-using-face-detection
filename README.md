## About

This project is a facial keypoint detection system built using TensorFlow and OpenCV. It accurately locates and identifies key facial landmarks such as eyes, nose, and mouth. The project uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, trained on a labeled dataset of facial images, to predict the coordinates of these keypoints. This capability enables various applications in facial analysis and augmentation.

## Dataset

You can find the dataset used in this project [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1aZb5RdY6PYT2mUfyTbCiZEkbacKLt2zB?usp=sharing).

The dataset includes labeled facial images, which serve as the training and testing data for the model. It contains images with annotated keypoints, such as eyes, nose, and mouth. The dataset may require preprocessing steps like resizing, normalization, and augmentation to improve the model's performance.
